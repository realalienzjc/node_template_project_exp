npm install





## TODO

* TODO: print a list of available tasks;
* TODO: research to find a way (e.g. interactive session or a config file with commenting/uncommenting) in order to generate least possible node modules inside package.json
* TODO: if moving 'config'(constants, directories) into a .json file, adding an extra validation process.
    Also, json has NOT commenting functionality, and every key value pairs has to be String, which making syntax highlighting not useful for checking.  Considering convert js object into json.
